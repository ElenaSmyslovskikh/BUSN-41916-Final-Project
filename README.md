Bayes, AI and Deep Learning (BUSN 41916) - Final Project

Neuromarketing is an interdisciplinary area of study at the intersection of neurological science, consumer behavior, and marketing. While deep learning has been evaluated for use with techniques such as EEG, there has been less research on how deep learning may be applied to fMRI data in the context of neuromarketing. In this study we trained a convolutional neural network on fMRI data to evaluate its potential application in this area. We found that the best predictions are produced for brain regions responsible for visual perception of color, form, and motion. This suggests that style-related features of images might have a more significant effect on attention than others.
